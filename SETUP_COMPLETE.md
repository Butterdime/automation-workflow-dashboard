## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Run Initial Setup
```bash
cd /Users/puvansivanasan/Documents/CP/approval-ci-dashboard
./scripts/setup.sh
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
```bash

nano api/.env
```

**Required configurations:**
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Your GitHub Personal Access Token
- `DASHBOARD_ORIGIN`: Your dashboard URL (for CORS)
- Update organization list in `dashboard/approval-dashboard.html`

### 3. Start Development
```bash
# Start both API and dashboard servers
./start-dev.sh

# Or manually:
# Terminal 1: cd api && npm run dev
# Terminal 2: cd dashboard && npm run dev
```

### 4. Test Locally
- 📊 Dashboard: http://localhost:3001
- 🔧 API: http://localhost:3000
- ❤️ Health Check: http://localhost:3000/health

### 5. Deploy to Production
```bash
# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Configure environment variables
vercel env add GITHUB_TOKEN
vercel env add DASHBOARD_ORIGIN

# Deploy
./deploy.sh
```
