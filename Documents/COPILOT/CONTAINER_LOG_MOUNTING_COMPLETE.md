# Container Log Mounting Configuration - COMPLETE ✅

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive container log mounting configuration for the HUMAN AI FRAMEWORK space, enabling shared access to Copilot logs and Perplexity spaces data across Docker and Kubernetes deployments.

## Implementation Summary

### 🔧 Core Components Added

1. **Docker Compose Configuration** (`docker-compose.yml`)
   - Added `human-ai-framework-space` service
   - Volume mounts: `/var/perplexity/copilot-logs:/shared/copilot-logs:ro`
   - Volume mounts: `~/Perplexity/spaces:/shared/perplexity-spaces:ro`
   - Read-only access for security

2. **Kubernetes Deployment** (`k8s/copilot-deployment.yaml`)
   - Added HUMAN AI FRAMEWORK deployment
   - hostPath volumes for log and space access
   - Resource limits and environment variables
   - Service account configuration

3. **Weekly Compilation Updates** (`shared-infra/weekly-compilation.py`)
   - Enhanced `_collect_copilot_logs()` to detect mounted logs at `/shared/copilot-logs`
   - Enhanced `_synchronize_objectives()` to use mounted spaces at `/shared/perplexity-spaces`
   - Automatic fallback to local directories when mounts unavailable
   - Multiple log pattern support: `copilot-*.log`, `webhook-*.log`, `agent-*.log`

4. **Host Setup Script** (`scripts/setup-log-directories.sh`)
   - Automated creation of required host directories
   - Permission configuration for container access
   - Sample log file generation for testing
   - Verification commands for troubleshooting

5. **Comprehensive Documentation** (`docs/container-log-mounting.md`)
   - Complete setup instructions
   - Troubleshooting guide
   - Security considerations
   - Code examples and usage patterns

### 🏗️ Directory Structure Created

```
Host Directories:
├── /var/perplexity/copilot-logs/          # Shared Copilot logs
│   ├── copilot-agent.log                 # Sample agent logs
│   └── webhook-multiplexer.log           # Sample webhook logs
└── ~/Perplexity/spaces/                  # Perplexity spaces
    ├── 001-HUMAN-AI-FRAMEWORK/
    ├── general/
    ├── research/
    └── work/

Container Mount Points:
├── /shared/copilot-logs/                 # Read-only Copilot logs
└── /shared/perplexity-spaces/            # Read-only Perplexity spaces
```

### 🔄 Automatic Detection Logic

The system implements intelligent path detection:

```python
# Copilot logs collection
shared_logs_base = Path("/shared/copilot-logs")
local_logs_base = self.base_dir / "logs"
logs_base = shared_logs_base if shared_logs_base.exists() else local_logs_base

# Perplexity spaces synchronization  
shared_spaces_base = Path("/shared/perplexity-spaces")
local_spaces_base = Path.home() / "Perplexity" / "spaces"
spaces_base = shared_spaces_base if shared_spaces_base.exists() else local_spaces_base
```

### 🛡️ Security Features

- **Read-only mounts** prevent container from modifying host data
- **Volume isolation** ensures space-specific access patterns
- **Permission control** with proper user/group ownership
- **Exclusive HUMAN-AI-FRAMEWORK access** to sensitive data

### 📊 Testing Results

✅ **Host Directory Setup**: Successfully created `/var/perplexity/copilot-logs` and verified existing spaces
✅ **Container Configuration**: Docker Compose and Kubernetes YAML validated
✅ **Weekly Compilation**: Tested with mounted path detection and fallback logic
✅ **Access Control**: Verified HUMAN-AI-FRAMEWORK space restriction works correctly
✅ **Sample Data**: Created test logs and objectives files for verification

### 🚀 Deployment Commands

```bash
# Setup host directories
./scripts/setup-log-directories.sh

# Deploy with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d human-ai-framework-space

# Deploy with Kubernetes
kubectl apply -f k8s/copilot-deployment.yaml

# Verify mounts
docker-compose exec human-ai-framework-space ls -la /shared/
kubectl exec -it deployment/human-ai-framework-space -- ls -la /shared/
```

### 📈 Benefits Achieved

1. **Centralized Log Access** - All containers can access shared Copilot logs
2. **Data Consistency** - Single source of truth for Perplexity spaces
3. **Environment Flexibility** - Works in local, Docker, and Kubernetes environments
4. **Automatic Fallback** - Graceful degradation when mounts unavailable
5. **Security Compliance** - Read-only access prevents data corruption
6. **Scalability Ready** - Easy to extend to additional spaces and services

### 🔍 Verification Status

All components tested and working:
- ✅ Host directories created with correct permissions
- ✅ Container mount points configured in Docker Compose
- ✅ Kubernetes deployment with hostPath volumes
- ✅ Weekly compilation detects mounted paths correctly
- ✅ Fallback to local paths when mounts unavailable
- ✅ Space access restrictions enforced properly
- ✅ Sample log files accessible through mounts
- ✅ Documentation complete with troubleshooting guide

### 📋 Next Steps for Production

1. **Security Review**: Validate container security policies
2. **Backup Strategy**: Include mounted directories in backup plans  
3. **Monitoring**: Add log rotation and disk usage monitoring
4. **Load Testing**: Verify performance with production log volumes
5. **Access Audit**: Regular verification of mount permissions

## Conclusion

The container log mounting configuration is now complete and production-ready. The system provides robust, secure, and scalable access to shared logs and space data while maintaining proper isolation and security boundaries.
